# Introduction
Learning about FBLA can be very challenging at times. Often times, the methods of learning about FBLA are simply not immersive enough and it is easy to lose focus and move on to something else. This is why we created Quizio which is an interactive  way of both learning and testing your knowledge. Quizio is an IOS application built specifically to fit a FBLA competitorâ€™s needs. Quizio provides students with study tools essential to ones success ranging from practice quizzes, posts for user questions, personalized learning experience with flash cards, and video resources. Our simple and unique UI ensures users spend their quality time on Quizio gaining aid. Our motto is simple. Knowledge is power. 



# Requirements
* 

## Installation
Quizio is not available on the iOS App Store so you must run this app through xcode
# Software Used
We used XCode for developing iOS applications. For the app's icon and a large majority of the UI, we used sketch. Finally, we used 
github to store our code online to have all members of our team working on the most updated version of the code as possible.
